<p align="center">My name is Mosch and I am a 14 year old self-taught software developer and reverse engineer from Germany. I am mainly focused on learning C++ and C. I am very interested in modifying video games, especially Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but I am also interested in other games. </p>
