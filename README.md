<p align="center">My name is Mosch and I am a self-taught software developer and reverse engineer from Germany. I am mainly focused on learning C++ and C. I am very interested in gamehacking, especially Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but I am also interested in other games. I am open to new projects. You can see my projects in the repository tab on my Github page.</p>
