<p align="center">My name is Mosch and I am a 14 year old self-taught software developer and reverse engineer from Germany. I am mainly focused on learning C++ and C. I am very interested in gamehacking, especially Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, but I am also interested in other games. I am open to new projects and challenges. You can see my projects in the repository tab on my Github page. If you want to contact me, check out my social media below.</p>
